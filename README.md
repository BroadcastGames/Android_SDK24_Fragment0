# Android_SDK24_Fragment0

Android SDK 24 Android Studio 2.2.2 Fragment Changing Test App

This is mostly code creatd by the Android Studio 2.2.2 wizards. As best as I can interpret the SDK documentation, this is how you go about changing fragmeents.

Pressing the Floating Action Button "email icon" should change you to the Blank fragment, along with the background color.
