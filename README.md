# Android_SDK24_Fragment0

Android SDK 24 Android Studio 2.2.2 Fragment Changing Test App

This is mostly code created by the Android Studio 2.2.2 wizards from New Project menu / add Fragment actions. As best as I can interpret the SDK documentation, this is how you go about changing fragmeents.

Pressing the Floating Action Button "email icon" should change you to the Blank fragment, which has a distinctive background color.
